Shop With Me is a real-time collaborative shopping list built with PubNub.

Pubnub is data stream network for developers to build realtime web applications.

At Stamplay we love PubNub because we love the real-time web, and how simple PubNub makes building real-time features in our applications.

Recently we added Pubnub as an integration for Stamplay, and we are very excited to show you how to get started with Stamplay + PubNub.

### Shop With Me

To showcase how to use PubNub we will be building a collaborative shopping list, **Shop With Me**, where users may check off items on a list, and the list we be updated for all who are currently viewing it.
